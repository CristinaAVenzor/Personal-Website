I specialize in turning complex data sets into clear, actionable visualizations using tools like Ggplot2, Rmarkdown and Quarto in R, Stremlite in Python, Tableau, and Power BI.

My visualizations not only display data effectively but tell a story that stakeholders can easily understand and act upon. Whether presenting to executives or providing reports for cross-functional teams, your ability to simplify and communicate intricate data insights in a visually engaging way is a key asset.
