title = "From Challenge to Change: My Passion for Educational Access and Methodological Research"

+++

Growing up in a tiny community in Mexico, I experienced firsthand the transformative power of education. My personal journey inspired me to focus my research on the profound impact that educational access and quality have on life outcomes.

As I progressed through my studies, I became increasingly drawn to technology in education and methodological approaches like impact evaluation and causal inference. I am particularly passionate about exploring how blended learning models and AI-driven tools can improve access to education in marginalized communities. By leveraging econometrics and data analysis, I aim to measure the effectiveness of these innovations and drive evidence-based improvements in educational policy.

Ultimately, my goal is to address educational disparities by applying rigorous methodologies that create scalable, data-driven solutions, ensuring that quality education reaches the communities that need it most.
